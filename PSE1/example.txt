You: what is color of rainbow?

Assistant: To answer your question about the colors of a rainbow, I will proceed step-by-step:

1. **Identify the phenomenon:** A rainbow is an optical and meteorological phenomenon that is caused by reflection, refraction and dispersion of light in water droplets resulting in a spectrum of light appearing in the sky.

2. **Identify the colors:**  The colors are not sharply defined, and blend into each other smoothly. However, a commonly used mnemonic is ROY G. BIV.

3. **List the colors according to ROY G. BIV:**

* **R**ed
* **O**range
* **Y**ellow
* **G**reen
* **B**lue
* **I**ndigo
* **V**iolet


Therefore, a rainbow displays the colors of the visible light spectrum, which includes red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.

You: tell me why sky is blue?

Assistant: To understand why the sky is blue, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Sunlight and its colors:** Sunlight appears white to us, but it's actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow.  Think of a prism separating white light into its constituent colors.

2. **Rayleigh scattering:**  When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with tiny air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen). This collision is called scattering.  Rayleigh scattering affects shorter wavelengths of light more strongly than longer wavelengths.

3. **Wavelengths of light:**  Different colors of light have different wavelengths.  Violet and blue light have shorter wavelengths, while red and orange light have longer wavelengths.

4. **Scattering effect on blue light:** Because of Rayleigh scattering, the shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are scattered much more than the longer wavelengths. This scattered light is what we see when we look at the sky.

5. **Why not violet?:** While violet light is scattered even more than blue light, our eyes are less sensitive to violet, and the sun emits slightly less violet light. This is why we perceive the sky as blue rather than violet.

In summary: The sky is blue because of Rayleigh scattering, which preferentially scatters blue and violet light from the sun more than other colors.  Our eyes' sensitivity to blue makes it the dominant color we perceive.
